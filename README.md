## 🐉 Battle Game

A simple text based battle game written in Python where you choose a character to fight against a dragon in a turn based combat loop.

## 💡 How It Works

You choose from 4 characters: Wizard, Elf, Human, or Kalisi

Each character has unique HP (Health Points) and Damage

The Dragon has 300 HP and deals 50 damage each turn

You and the Dragon take turns attacking until one of you runs out of HP

## 🧙‍♂️ Characters
Character	HP	Damage
Wizard	150	150
Elf	100	100
Human	150	20
Kalisi	900	5

💀 The Dragon has 300 HP and deals 50 Damage per turn.

## 🚀 How to Play

Choose your character by typing its name (e.g., wizard, elf, etc.)

The battle begins!

Fight continues until either the dragon or your character is defeated
